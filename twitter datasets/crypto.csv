1. Benefit 100% from asset appreciation. (vs none for subguilds)
 
2. Have a much higher take rate on their revenues. For example, Merit now takes 30% vs YGG 10%. Meaning, the DAO has a 3x better profit margin."
1456626365957029891,2021-11-05 14:16:03,64,4,"8/ This also makes the structure less prone to SubGuilds leaving the Main DAO. Since they are tied in with all their assets and by sharing the same token.
 
It is very likely, guilds will branch off once they are big enough to leverage their own brand."
1456626364027744260,2021-11-05 14:16:02,69,4,"7/ The SuperGuild structure also allows for SubGuilds under the main brand, but SubGuilds are directly integrated into the main ecosystem. Sharing the same token.
 
This allows for division of governance and community, without sacrificing network value = $MC token value."
1456626361825693703,2021-11-05 14:16:02,68,5,"6/ Guilds in the Guild of Guilds model maintain ownership of their assets (NFT's and other treasury assets) and can have a separate token.
 
Conversely, this means Yield Guild doesn't own any of the assets from the subGuilds. Only the take rate benefits $YGG directly."
1456626359795605508,2021-11-05 14:16:01,96,5,"5/ Structure
 
Merit Circle takes a SuperGuild approach over a Guild of Guilds approach
 
A Guild of Guilds approach, employed by YieldGuild is a flexible structure that allows for franchising of other guilds. In simple terms. Guilds pay a 10% take rate to leverage the $YGG brand"
1456626357623005188,2021-11-05 14:16:01,107,4,"4/  However, you wouldn‚Äôt just take any index. You‚Äôd want your index to have the right leadership, (infra)structure and community. This is what will allow the index to make the right bets. Of the few gaming DAO‚Äôs (Superguilds) on offer, $MC is the only one that ticks all boxes."
