# Week 2: Intro to ML

# General agenda items

- Go over homework, share findings/blockers

# Main tasks

- Review/skim reading one more time
- TensorFlow overview
- Go over basic MLP example using Python/TensorFlow
- Go over coding environment (Google Colab + GitHub workflow)

# Homework

- Set up environment and make a sample PR to our repo with your fully-connected neural network solution to Fashion MNIST
  - Fashion MNIST is available through `tf.keras.datasets.fashion_mnist`
  - I recommend reading up on the problem and studying the notebook
- Read through the **fun** Federated Learning comic
- Read about RNNs using the Sequence Modeling chapter (beginning to 10.2 [incl.], 10.4-10.5 [incl.])
- Read through LSTM Blog Post
